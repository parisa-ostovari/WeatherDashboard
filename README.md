# WeatherDashboard

This is a simple web application that allows the user to search for a city, within the United State, and retrieve the current weather and a 5 day forecast. The current weather will provide the user with the temperature, humidity, wind speed and UV index (green:low, yellow:medium, red:high). Using local storage, your most 5 recent city searches will be saved for future viewing.
